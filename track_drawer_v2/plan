Track Drawer V2

application starts, big window.
main is grid of 1x1m squares with two orange cones at -X, X.
At bottom are 4 "altitude" graphs- distance from midline of line, distance between cones for each colour.
Each of these altitude graphs has a default setting that can be edited. (one overrider for both dists)
Side of window represents what the CSV will look like- but with separate sections for blue, yellow, etc + car pos.
In this section, rows can be dragged to change their order, and hovering them will highlight the cone on the grid.
Can edit everything in the grid from the table entries.
Toolbar with all cone placer, midpoint planner, initial car position placer.
also selector, mover, recolourer, and colours for each cone colour.
Help tab with descriptions of tools, keyboard shortcuts, and description of workflow.

Workflow:

draw midline points. Code generates smooth line through each point in order. Then code auto generates blue and yellow cones by offsetting the line
based on the altitude graphs.
These cones are marked graphically (and in table) to show they are autogenerated, and will be replaced if the graphs or midline is changed.
All cones have an anchoring line to the midline, so if the midline moves it is clear how they should move.
Also makes it easy to determine the order of cones.
Anchor points can be moved when cone is selected.

Car position can be placed and its angle spun around.
